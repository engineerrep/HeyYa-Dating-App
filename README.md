## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Project Summary

Heyya is a mobile social application developed by Heyya team, aiming to connect people by sharing daily moments from their lives. The main interface of Heyya is a waterfall-style dynamic feed, where users can share photos, short videos, and text updates. Users can interact with each other through likes, comments, and reposts. Users can also follow people they are interested in and create their channels based on topics of interest. Heyya also has an Explore page where users can browse hot topics and channels. The app also has features like direct messaging, story sharing, and live streaming for deeper social interaction. 

Overall, Heyya is an active social platform that encourages users to share every moment of their lives. It uses a minimalist interface and smooth user experience to build an interactive community where users can connect, share experiences, discover common interests, and make friends.

### 1.2 Project Features

1. Dynamic Social Feed: The core feature of Heyya is the waterfall-style dynamic social feed, where users can share photos, short videos, and life updates. Users can upload posts anytime and interact with other users.

2. Follow and Channels: Users can follow friends and topic channels of interest. Channel content is generated by users, covering various topics, making it easy to discover users with common interests and content.

3. Direct Messaging and Live Streaming: Heyya not only has a social feed but also provides ways to communicate privately. Users can use direct messaging for instant communication. Heyya also has live streaming functionality, allowing users to interact with others through their mobile devices.

4. Explore Page: Heyya has an Explore page that highlights popular topics, channels, and users, making it easier for new users to find content and communities that interest them.

5. Story Sharing: Heyya allows users to create stories by combining multiple photos and videos, telling a life experience or a project progress. This new content form encourages users to share more coherent stories with others.

6. Obtaining Fans and Influence: Like other social platforms, Heyya also has a mechanism for fans and influence. Users can gain higher fans and influence by generating popular content and interaction.

## 2. Getting Started

To run and deploy Heyya, follow these steps:

#### 1、The project uses a third-party framework

###### GetX (https://www.liujunmin.com/flutter/getx/introduction.html#navigation%E8%B7%AF%E7%94%B1%E8%B7%B3%E8%BD%AC) [4.6.5](https://pub.dev/packages/get)

###### Network：Dio


#### 2、Package/Module

###### <!--Packaging tools-->

- Package Snackbar、Dialog、BottomSheet （Class method、GetX）
- Routes（GetX）
- Theme（GetX）
- Fonts
- Network
- Session,Account and User
- Albums
- Albums for uploading



###### <!--Componentization-->

[Link](https://juejin.cn/post/7006236078218674207)

```Dart
If there is IM, consider componentized development and avoid mixing with getx architecture



#### 3、Coding style

##### 1. Responsive use attribute .obs writing method instead of Rx writing method

```dart
// Instantiate
var name = "Ax".obs
  
// Use Obx(()=> to update Text() whenever count is changed.
child: Obx(() => Text(
              "My name is ${name.value}",
              style: TextStyle(color: Colors.red, fontSize: 30),
            )),

// or
child: GetBuilder<GetxController>(
  builder: (controller) {
          return Text()
  })
  
 
// or 1
ValueBuilder<bool>(
  initialValue: false,
  builder: (value, updateFn) => Switch(
    value: value,
    onChanged: updateFn, // same signature! you could use ( newValue ) => updateFn( newValue )
  ),
  // if you need to call something outside the builder method.
  onUpdate: (value) => print("Value updated: $value"),
  onDispose: () => print("Widget unmounted"),
),

// or 2
ObxValue((data) => Switch(
        value: data.value,
        onChanged: data, // Rx has a _callable_ function! You could use (flag) => data.value = flag,
    ),
    false.obs,
),

```



###### If the page has only one controller, use GetxController + GetView

```dart
 class AwesomeController extends GetController {
   final String title = 'My Awesome View';
 }

  // ALWAYS remember to pass the `Type` you used to register your controller!
 class AwesomeView extends GetView<AwesomeController> {
   @override
   Widget build(BuildContext context) {
     return Container(
       padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
       child: Text(controller.title), // just call `controller.something`
       // child: obx(()=> return Text(controller.title)),
     );
   }
 }
```
##### 2. obs Useful tips

```dart
final name = 'GetX'.obs;
// only "updates" the stream, if the value is different from the current one.
name.value = 'Hey';

// All Rx properties are "callable" and returns the new value.
// but this approach does not accepts `null`, the UI will not rebuild.
name('Hello');

// is like a getter, prints 'Hello'.
name() ;

/// numbers:

final count = 0.obs;

// You can use all non mutable operations from num primitives!
count + 1;

// Watch out! this is only valid if `count` is not final, but var
count += 1;

// You can also compare against values:
count > 2;

/// booleans:

final flag = false.obs;

// switches the value between true/false
flag.toggle();


/// all types:

// Sets the `value` to null.
flag.nil();

// All toString(), toJson() operations are passed down to the `value`
print( count ); // calls `toString()` inside  for RxInt

final abc = [0,1,2].obs;
// Converts the value to a json Array, prints RxList
// Json is supported by all Rx types!
print('json: ${jsonEncode(abc)}, type: ${abc.runtimeType}');

// RxMap, RxList and RxSet are special Rx types, that extends their native types.
// but you can work with a List as a regular list, although is reactive!
abc.add(12); // pushes 12 to the list, and UPDATES the stream.
abc[3]; // like Lists, reads the index 3.


// equality works with the Rx and the value, but hashCode is always taken from the value
final number = 12.obs;
print( number == 12 ); // prints > true

/// Custom Rx Models:

// toJson(), toString() are deferred to the child, so you can implement override on them, and print() the observable directly.

class User {
    String name, last;
    int age;
    User({this.name, this.last, this.age});

    @override
    String toString() => '$name $last, $age years old';
}

final user = User(name: 'John', last: 'Doe', age: 33).obs;

// `user` is "reactive", but the properties inside ARE NOT!
// So, if we change some variable inside of it...
user.value.name = 'Roi';
// The widget will not rebuild!,
// `Rx` don't have any clue when you change something inside user.
// So, for custom classes, we need to manually "notify" the change.
user.refresh();

// or we can use the `update()` method!
user.update((value){
  value.name='Roi';
});

print( user );
```





##### 3. Model class

`模型使用自动生成的插件。在生成文件夹中，没有对代码的入侵。不要在Model类中编写自定义方法。`

<!--GetxController，Class as data definition, business logic processing, network request-->

```dart
// network works like
controller.fetchXXXApi();

// update data
controller.updateXXX();


```

##### 4.Network requests and model operations

```dart
// repository define + impl

// repository lazy loading （Bindings）
```



##### 5. Some methods of obtaining system constants

```dart
//Check in what platform the app is running
GetPlatform.isAndroid
GetPlatform.isIOS
  
  // Equivalent to : MediaQuery.of(context).size.height,
// but immutable.
Get.height
Get.width

// Gives the current context of the Navigator.
Get.context

// Gives the context of the snackbar/dialog/bottomsheet in the foreground, anywhere in your code.
Get.contextOverlay

// Note: the following methods are extensions on context. Since you
// have access to context in any place of your UI, you can use it anywhere in the UI code

// If you need a changeable height/width (like Desktop or browser windows that can be scaled) you will need to use context.
context.width
context.height

```



##### 6.Binding 

`Use Binding to initialize all Controllers to solve the problem of repeated initialization`

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    /// GetX Binding
    return GetMaterialApp(
      title: "GetX",
      initialBinding: AllControllerBinding(),
      home: GetXBindingExample(),
    );
  }
}


class AllControllerBinding implements Bindings {
  
  @override
  void dependencies() {
    // TODO: implement dependencies
    Get.lazyPut<BindingMyController>(() => BindingMyController());
    Get.lazyPut<BindingHomeController>(() => BindingHomeController());
  }
}



```

##### 7. Other Specifications

- For national related data, use StateMixin?

- Use the FlutterJsonBeanFactory plugin to avoid interfering with the code in model class files, which is not conducive to expansion.
